<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p><i>Covering Identity</i> is a comprehensive digital archive that provides a platform to examine the evolving presence of black individuals on book covers across genres, and how these representations have evolved over time, regardless of the author's creed, ethnicity, gender, and race. Itâ€™s a unique and inclusive project that explores and celebrates the multifaceted world of literature through its visual dimensions with the intention of fostering a dynamic discussion of representation and its implications. <i>Covering Identity</i> features critical essays, interviews, and multimedia content from experts, authors, and artists who have engaged with the topic of visual representation in literature.</p>

<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p><i>Covering Identity</i> is a comprehensive digital archive that provides a platform to examine the evolving presence of black individuals on book covers across genres, and how these representations have evolved over time, regardless of the author's creed, ethnicity, gender, and race. Itâ€™s a unique and inclusive project that explores and celebrates the multifaceted world of literature through its visual dimensions with the intention of fostering a dynamic discussion of representation and its implications. <i>Covering Identity</i> features critical essays, interviews, and multimedia content from experts, authors, and artists who have engaged with the topic of visual representation in literature.</p>
		<br/>
<p>Researchers, scholars, designers, and enthusiasts can access a wealth of high-resolution book cover images, each accompanied by comprehensive metadata that includes details about the book's title, author, publication date, genre, designer, and additional contextual information. Users can explore the collection through intuitive search functions, allowing them to explore themes, trends, historical, and sociopolitical shifts in book cover design related to black representation. <i>Covering Identity</i> serves as a bridge between literature, visual culture, and social discourse, contributing to a broader understanding of the role of visual representation in shaping our perceptions of race and identity in the literary world.</p>

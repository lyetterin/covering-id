<h2>WELCOME!</h2>
<p><i>All of We</i> is a satellite project from <i>One More Voice</i> that highlights the creation of the complex Caribbean identities through the exploration of personal accounts of historical events spanning from slavery to the fall of British colonialism. <i>All of We</i> is created and maintained by a Bahamian woman, Lyette Erin, for her fellow Caribbean people. <i>All of We</i> takes a <b>"for us, by us"</b> approach; therefore great care is taken to ensure that majority of the materials, academic sources, and photographs referenced are from the community of the people being discussed.</p>

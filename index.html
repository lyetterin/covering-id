<h3>VISUAL COMMUNICATION</h3>
<p>Visual communications of any kind, whether persuasive or informative, from billboards to birth announcements, should be seens as the embodiment of form and function: <i>the integration of the beautiful and the useful</i>. Book cover design is a fascinating challenge of visual communication. The cover carries a huge responsibility&#8212;to catch the reader’s attention on the shelf, give a sense of the book’s tone and atmosphere, draw them into the story, and create a kind of visual emblem for the entire narrative. And it’s not just that book cover designers must translate words in images, which is itself a creative challenge. They must translate imagination into a physical object.</p>
<p>As a designed object, the book cover is a first look at the text and a visual rendering of what the text says: it is both an interpretation and a translation from verbal into visual signifiers. While the cover designer may wish to convey something original, there are constraints on the design process, since the book cover also serves as a kind of information kiosk that not only indicates author, title, and publisher but also locates the book in relation to genre.</p>
